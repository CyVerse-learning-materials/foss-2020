**Introduction to Reproducible Science** 
===================

The so-called reproducibility crisis (`1 <https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970>`_, `2 <https://www.nature.com/collections/prbfkwmwvz>`_, `3 <https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/to-fix-the-reproducibility-crisis-rethink-how-we-do-experiments/>`_) in science has led to fundamental changes in how we approach research.
